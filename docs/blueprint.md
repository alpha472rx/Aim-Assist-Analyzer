# **App Name**: Aim Assist Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Code Display: Display the Python code for aim assist and aimlock algorithms, including distance and angle calculations. This serves as the 'About' or educational section for those interested in the specifics of how these tools work.
- Simulation Setup: Allow users to configure simulation parameters such as player and enemy positions, aim assist strength, and base damage.
- Aim Assist Simulation: Simulate aim assist by smoothly adjusting the player's aim towards a target, based on configurable strength and other simulation parameters. Show a live representation of the degree to which the target is followed, including optional visualizations. Add randomness where needed, based on a tool, to make the outcome appear to be organic and human-like.
- Aimlock Simulation: Simulate aimlock by instantly locking the player's aim onto a target to demonstrate how an aimlock works compared to an aim assist.
- Shooting Simulation: Simulate shooting mechanics based on aim accuracy (angle difference between crosshair and target), and implement a random damage multiplier for headshots vs. body shots. Show the effects of accuracy visually and/or via damage output.
- Performance Analysis: Record data from simulations, such as time to target, shots fired, and accuracy, and present it visually (graphs and charts) to compare the effectiveness of aim assist vs. manual aiming vs. aimlock.
- Interactive Tutorials: AI-driven tool offering interactive tutorials and explanations about different aiming techniques, ethical considerations, and the implications of using aim-assist or aimlock systems.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to reflect a technological and simulation-based aesthetic.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2E3440) to provide a high contrast environment that emphasizes the simulations and data visualizations.
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14) for interactive elements, highlights, and data points to draw user attention to key simulation aspects.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines to provide a tech-forward, precise look. Body font: 'Inter' for body text for clarity and readability, supporting educational content effectively.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospaced to ensure that code snippets are clearly displayed and easily distinguishable.
- Use clean, vector-based icons that represent simulation parameters, aiming modes, and analysis tools.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for the crosshair movement, target acquisition, and data updates to enhance user engagement and clarity.
